Hi, I’m Utkarsh 👋

I’m a first-year Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech interested in building at the intersection of hardware, software, and product. I enjoy learning by doing—whether that’s designing small PCBs, building mobile apps, or experimenting with early-stage ideas.

I’m currently exploring:
- Embedded systems and basic circuit design
- Mobile development with SwiftUI and Flutter
- How software and electrical systems come together in real products

This GitHub is a collection of projects, experiments, and things I’m learning along the way.
